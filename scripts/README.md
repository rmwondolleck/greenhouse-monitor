## Workflow Validation

### validate-workflows.py
Validates GitHub Actions workflow files for syntax and structure.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Validate a specific workflow
python3 scripts/validate-workflows.py .github/workflows/your-workflow.yml

# Validate all workflows
python3 scripts/validate-workflows.py .github/workflows/

# With verbose output
python3 scripts/validate-workflows.py .github/workflows/ --verbose
```

**What it validates:**
- ✅ YAML syntax correctness
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow structure
- ✅ Required fields (name, on, jobs)
- ✅ Job structure (runs-on, steps)

- CI workflow: `.github/workflows/workflow-validation.yml`
- YAML lint config: `.yamllint`

## Issue Creation

**⚠️ DEPRECATED: NPM Scripts Removed**

Issue creation scripts have been removed from this project. We now use **GitHub Copilot's native @issue-creator agent** instead.

### Use the GitHub Copilot Agent

To create issues from templates in `docs/github-issues/`, use the @issue-creator agent in GitHub Copilot Chat:

```
@issue-creator show me all available issues
@issue-creator create all high-priority issues
@issue-creator create issues #1 and #2
```

**Benefits of using the agent:**
- ✅ No setup required (no GITHUB_TOKEN needed)
- ✅ Natural conversation interface
- ✅ Interactive and flexible
- ✅ Smart duplicate detection
- ✅ Native GitHub integration via MCP

### Documentation

For detailed instructions on using the @issue-creator agent:

- **Usage Examples**: [docs/github-issues/USAGE_EXAMPLE.md](../docs/github-issues/USAGE_EXAMPLE.md)
- **Quick Start**: [README.md](../README.md#issue-creator-agent)

### Migration Notes

The previous NPM scripts (`create-issues`, `create-issues:interactive`) have been completely removed. All issue creation now goes through the GitHub Copilot agent, which provides a superior user experience with native GitHub integration.

If you're looking for the old scripts, they were removed in favor of the agent-based approach. The agent uses GitHub's MCP (Model Context Protocol) to create issues directly from Copilot Chat without any additional setup or scripting.
